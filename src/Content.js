            Kris accidentally discovered her love of fitness at a young age. Her active childhood was spurred by her own insistence at accumulating as many extracurricular activities as possible for college applications. 
            Over the years, she was on the cross country, track and field, lacrosse, tennis, and swim teams. She continued team sports through college.

            Today, Kris is a marathoner. You can usually find her running throughout the five boroughs of NYC. 
            To date, she has run four marathons (including two of the World Marathon Majors) and countless shorter races. 
            Her next goal is to qualify for the Boston Marathon. Her interest in group fitness peaked when she understood the importance of integrating strength training into her running. 
            She found that she enjoyed the encouragement of the trainer, team mentality, and low pressure environment of classes, all of which she aims to provide in her own classes.
